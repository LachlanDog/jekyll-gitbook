Ko’Themar:

-   Lots of dwarven monuments, six ones facing away from the city
    
-   Lots of Blue Arctic Roses -- a stoic flower native to the region
    
-   Different districts have cool names: fancier one, crafting one, arcane one
    

-   Different tavern options, many types, spas, baths, brothels:
    

-   Fools blade: mid/lower range -- this is where we’re staying
    
-   Brightcastle: Higher end
    
-   Velvet Pillow: Brothel
    

-   Temple
    

-   A priest or something named Gull sent me to the Prodigal manner (grand temper), or some shrine in the Hell hound district 
    
-   Its super naturey and druidy there are birds and I like them
    
-   Temple to the Lord of Plants

Lachlan spoke to someone named Holderheck -- leader of a religious order, needs some jobs done

-   In particular, wants a Young White Dragon to stop from attacking neighbouring towns
    
-   Young White Dragon: Second smallest, uses cold/arctic attacks
    

-   One of them most vicious of the chromatic dragons, makes up for the fact that they’re more simplistic -- not very vengeful or play with food, just hunts and kills
    

Market District:

-   Octavius Oddities -- guy Aloy told us to look up but not mention her to
    

-   David -- shopowner? Eccentric hot half orc
    
-   Carmella -- Half-elf girl who works for him, city doesn’t like her
    
-   Made some secret deal with him to kill a monster in the sewers -- 3000 gold + lepurine helmet for Vola -- must keep it top secret and tell no one
    

-   Could be to set up thieve’s guild or set up secret pass to Nym Thalas through sewers?
