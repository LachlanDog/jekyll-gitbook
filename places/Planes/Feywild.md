‘The feywild exists as an echo of the material plane.’

Time is weird, but can’t know in which direction (ie contracted or dilated) until you get out and see

Magic is wild, at least for fae, much more powerful, probably a lot more powerfully magical creature

  

Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn court -- the main oppositing factions are summer and winter; spring and autumn are especially opportunistic

The courts do not want to necessarily eliminate one another, it’s just that they’re always vying for power against one another

Neutral courts like twilight

  

Seelie Court -- summer, good

Unseelie Court -- winter, evil

  

Analogous in a way to modrons not being aware of things except those directly above or below them -- the fae know of the existence of things, but find things outside of their own relative power insignificant, ie ‘why would I care about you?’

# What Varenzai knows about the Feywild

‘A shadow over this place, magical place’ Leylines from here cross over to this world.

Courts of the seasons (Spring, Summer, Winter, Fall)

Briza stole the heart from the queen of the winter court

It’s where Varenzai’s people are now.
