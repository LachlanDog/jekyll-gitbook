Chaotic, not sure if there's any rules.

Not an [[Abysal_Plane]] of hell, but can be nightmarish.

Weird shifty, sometimes hear music and then it's gone...

See stairs going up and down...

Nothing constant

Chaotic

Doesn’t make sense

Not an abyss or plane of hell -- but just like a dream it can be nightmarish
